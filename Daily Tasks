If you want, I can also give the exact Java programs, SQL queries, and Docker commands you should run today so you can just follow step by step and complete all tasks without thinking too much about what to do next.

Do you want me to do that?
---------------

Excellent 👏 — that’s exactly the discipline that builds mastery.
Since you’ve completed Day 1, we’ll now move to Day 2, which slightly increases the difficulty level — connecting yesterday’s fundamentals (Java, Collections, SQL, Spring Boot basics, Singleton pattern, Docker intro) with new core topics like Exception handling, Streams, HashMap internals, SQL Joins, Spring REST APIs, and one new Design Pattern (Factory).


---

🌟 Day 2: Deep Dive into Java Core + REST API + SQL Joins + Factory Pattern

🕒 Timeframe: 7:00 AM – 10:00 PM
💡 Focus: Write clean code, understand “why” behind concepts, start connecting logic with Spring Boot project.
🍴 Includes all health breaks (tea, lunch, dinner).

🧩 Day 2 Detailed Schedule

Time	Activity	Task Description	Reference / Resource

7:00 – 7:30 AM	☀️ Morning Warm-up	Revise Day 1 notes — focus on Collections, Spring Boot Hello World, and Docker commands.	Your notes / tracker
7:30 – 9:00 AM	💻 Java Programming	🔹 Write 3 programs: <br>1. Reverse words in a sentence using StringBuilder <br>2. Count frequency of each character in a string (use HashMap) <br>3. Check if a number is prime. <br><br>Then, explore Java Exception handling – checked vs unchecked, try-with-resources.	Core Java Vol 1, GeeksforGeeks, Oracle Java Tutorials
9:00 – 9:15 AM	☕ Tea Break	Short walk, hydrate	
9:15 – 10:45 AM	🧠 Java Collections Deep Dive	1. Understand HashMap internal working (hashing, equals, hashCode). <br>2. Implement your own mini HashMap using an array of LinkedLists. <br>3.
