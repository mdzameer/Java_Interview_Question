Project Overview: Library Management System

Problem Statement:
Design a backend system for a library to manage books, members, loans/returns, reservations, fines, and catalog searches. It should support role-based access (members, librarians, admins), maintain inventory, handle notifications (due reminders, fines), and integrate with payment gateways for fine payments. Ensure secure authentication and scalable service design.

Microservices Description

· Auth / User Service:
Handles member and staff registration, login, JWT token issuance, role & permission management, password reset.

· Book / Catalog Service:
Manages book metadata, authors, publishers, categories, cover images and indexing for search.

· Inventory / Copy Service:
Tracks physical copies (copy id, barcode), locations (shelf/branch), status transitions (available, loaned, reserved, lost, maintenance).

· Loan Service:
Processes borrow requests, returns, renewals, enforces borrowing rules (max books, loan period), updates inventory status.

· Reservation (Hold) Service:
Lets members place holds on unavailable copies, manages waitlists and notifications when copies become available.

· Fine & Payment Service:
Calculates fines (daily/flat), handles payment processing and status updates, provides receipts.

· Notification Service:
Sends emails/SMS/in-app notifications for due reminders, overdue, reservation ready, payment confirmations (Kafka or direct).

· Search Service (optional):
Provides advanced search (Elasticsearch) for titles, authors, ISBN, full-text, and faceted filters.

· API Gateway:
Routes client requests, handles cross-cutting concerns (rate-limiting, routing, TLS termination).

· Eureka / Service Discovery & Config Server:
Service registry and centralized configuration for different environments.

Architectural Details

Preferred Architecture: Microservices (small services per domain) with the following layered approach inside each service:
· Controller Layer (REST)
· Service Layer (Business Logic & Policies)
· Repository Layer (JPA/Hibernate)

External Components:
· Relational DB (Postgres recommended)
· Message broker (Kafka) for async events (e.g., reservation-ready, loan-created)
· Cache store (Redis) for sessions / hot search results
· Authentication provider (JWT, optionally OAuth2)

ER Diagram (Entities & Key Fields — Library-specific)

Member (id, name, email, phone, membershipType, joinedDate, status, address)

UserRole (id, roleName) — links to Member for permissions

Book (id, title, isbn, summary, language, publicationDate, publisherId, categoryId)

Author (id, name, bio)

BookAuthor (book_id, author_id) — many-to-many

Category (id, name, description)

Publisher (id, name, address)

PhysicalCopy (id, book_id, barcode, copyNumber, location, status)

Loan (id, copy_id, member_id, loanDate, dueDate, returnDate, status)

Reservation (id, book_id, member_id, reservedDate, status, positionInQueue)

Fine (id, loan_id, member_id, amount, issuedDate, paidDate, status)

Payment (id, fine_id, member_id, amount, transactionId, paymentDate, status)

Staff / Librarian (id, user_id, employeeId, role, branch)

AuditLog (id, entity, entityId, action, performedBy, timestamp)

Sequence Diagrams (Examples — textual steps)

1) Borrow (Loan) Flow

1. Member requests borrow for a book via frontend.


2. API Gateway → Loan Service: check member eligibility & limits.


3. Loan Service → Inventory Service: check available copies for requested book.


4. Inventory returns available copy id.


5. Loan Service creates Loan record, updates PhysicalCopy status → loaned.


6. Notification Service sends confirmation to member.


7. Response returned to user with due date and loan id.



2) Return Flow & Fine Calculation

1. Member returns copy; frontend or librarian scans barcode.


2. Inventory Service marks copy as available.


3. Loan Service records returnDate; calculates overdue days.


4. If overdue, Fine Service creates Fine record.


5. Notification Service notifies member of fine and payment link.


6. Member pays via Payment Service; Fine status updated to paid.



3) Reservation (Hold) Flow

1. Member places reservation for an unavailable book.


2. Reservation Service places member in waitlist (position).


3. When a copy becomes available, Inventory publishes event to Kafka.


4. Notification Service sends “reservation ready” to the first member in queue.


5. Member has limited hold-claim window → if not claimed, move to next member.

API Design (Endpoint Examples)

Auth & Users
· POST /api/auth/register — register member
· POST /api/auth/login — login, return JWT
· GET /api/users/{id} — get profile
· PUT /api/users/{id} — update profile

Catalog & Books
· GET /api/books — search/list books (filters: author, category, available)
· GET /api/books/{id} — book details + authors + availability summary
· POST /api/books — (admin) add book metadata
· PUT /api/books/{id} — (admin) update book

Inventory & Copies
· GET /api/books/{id}/copies — list copies and statuses
· POST /api/copies — add physical copy (admin)
· PUT /api/copies/{barcode}/status — update status (lost, maintenance)

· POST /api/loans — create loan (borrow)
· GET /api/loans?memberId= — list member loans

Fines & Payments
· GET /api/fines?memberId= — list fines
· POST /api/fines/{id}/pay — make payment (invoke Payment Service)
· GET /api/payments/{id} — payment status / receipt

Notifications & Reports (Admin)

Non-Functional Requirements & Policies

· Security: JWT auth, role-based access control, HTTPS everywhere, input validation, rate limiting.
· Scalability: Separate read/write services, caching for frequent queries, horizontally scalable stateless services.
· Consistency: Strong consistency for loan operations (use DB transactions / optimistic locking for copy status).
· Observability: Centralized logs, metrics, health checks, and alerts.
· Backup & Recovery: Regular DB backups and tested restore process.
· Data Retention & GDPR: Member data privacy, retention policies, and opt-out for marketing notifications.

Suggested Implementation Milestones (practical steps)

1. Initialize repo and create common libs (auth, common DTOs, error handling).


2. Implement Auth Service + User Service with JWT.


3. Implement Book Service + DB schema for Book/Author/Category.


4. Implement Inventory & Loan Services with transactional flows and tests.


5. Add Reservation + Notification pipelines (Kafka) and email provider integration.


6. Add Fine & Payment integration (start with mock gateway, then real).


7. Wire API Gateway, Eureka, Config Server, containerize, and deploy to staging.


8. Run end-to-end QA and load test critical flows (borrowing/return).

If you want, I can now:

convert the ER model into a SQL schema (DDL) for Postgres,

generate starter Spring Boot microservice templates (one-per-service) with suggested folder structure, or

produce detailed API specs (OpenAPI/Swagger) for one service (e.g., Loan Service).


Which one should I generate next?
